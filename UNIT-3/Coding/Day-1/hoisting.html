   // Hoisting 

   function codeHoist() {

       a = 10;

       let b = 50;

   }

   codeHoist();

   
   console.log(a)
   // 10
S
   console.log(b)
   // ReferenceError : b is not defined

   // Explanation: In the above code sample we created a function called codeHoist() 
//    and in there we have a variable which we didnâ€™t declare using let/var/const and 
//    a let variable b. The undeclared variable is assigned the global scope by javascript hence 
//    we are able to print it outside the function, but in case of the variable b the scope is 
//    confined and it is not available outside and we get a ReferenceError.
